Scripts for processing network telescope data archives
This collection of files are used for extracting various statistics out of packet traces (pcap).
While largely focussed on those collected on a network telescope, they should work on other captures.

Note these require dptk > 1.9.0 due to a bug in earlier versiosn which results in excessive RAM usage.
